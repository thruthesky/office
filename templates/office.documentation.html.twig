                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The group set May 15th, 2015 ( Friday ) is a rest day because it’s a special day.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            But only one employee will come to office to work on that day - May 15th, 2015.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The employee only works from 10 am to 2 pm. ( half day )
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            And the next day the employee rest ( no work. )
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What if all members of the group changes the work schedule?
                            like on this coming monday only, the group work on 6 am to 10 am only.
                            You can do it on work schedule with empty user name.
